## Dynamic Programming:

####  1. Climbing stairs :
For n stairs and k possible steps Find number of ways to climb all stairs.
Recursive Complexity: Exponential
Time complexity: O(n).

#### 2. Counting Rods : 
For a rod of size n and given the cost of selling rod at a particular length
Find the maximum profit by selling it.
Recursive Complexity: Exponential: O(2^n)
Time complexity: O(n^2)

#### 2. House Robbing : 
Given an array of houses, the robber can rob a house or will not.
If he robs a house i, he cannot rob a house i-1.
Find the maximum stolen money.
Recursive Complexity: Exponential: O(2^n)
Time complexity: O(n)

#### 2. Buy and sell Stock : 
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction 
(ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Recursive Complexity: Exponential: O(n^2)
Time complexity: O(n)
