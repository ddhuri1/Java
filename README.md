## Dynamic Programming:

####  1. Climbing stairs :
For n stairs and k possible steps Find number of ways to climb all stairs.
Recursive Complexity: Exponential
Time complexity: O(n).

#### 2. Counting Rods : 
For a rod of size n and given the cost of selling rod at a particular length
Find the maximum profit by selling it.
Recursive Complexity: Exponential: O(2^n)
Time complexity: O(n^2)
